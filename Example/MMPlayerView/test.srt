56
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,420
Nick, this was a tragedy, but it's not why we're here.

57
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,690
What, are we fighting the weather now?

58
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,890
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

59
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,290
People see things when they're under stress.

60
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,290
Okay? That does not mean that this is the start

61
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,820
to some other big world-ending--

62
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,560
Who are you?

63
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,420
You don't want any part of this.

64
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,690
And I...

65
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,620
Will always love you, ooh

66
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:08,190
Will always love you

67
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,990
You

68
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,650
My darling, you...

69
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,620
Bittersweet

70
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,990
Memories

71
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,360
That is all

72
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm taking

73
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,360
With me

74
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,850
And I

75
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,220
Will always love you

76
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,490
I will always

77
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,490
Love you

78
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,220
I, I will always

79
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,750
Love you

80
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,820
Gone, but not forgotten.

81
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,890
Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy

82
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,150
for their help with that touching video tribute.

83
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,350
This year has been nothing short of--

84
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,690
...is crazy. It's, like, insane.

85
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,620
- Jason. - What?

86
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,650
No swearing.

87
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
Yeah. It's the last day of school. We're good.

88
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,250
Historic.

89
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,520
Over five years ago,

90
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,350
half of all life in the universe,

91
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,490
including our own Midtown High...

92
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,360
...was wiped from existence.

93
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,920
But then eight months ago,

94
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,560
a band of brave heroes brought us back.

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,560
They called it "The Blip."

96
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,420
Those of us who Blipped away came back the same age...

97
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,390
But our classmates that didn't Blip

98
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,890
had grown five years older.

99
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,460
Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me.

100
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,820
Yeah, it's math.

101
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,250
And even though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year

102
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,520
and had already taken midterms,

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,390
the school made us start the year over from the beginning.

104
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,990
It's totally unfair. It's not right.

105
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,290
Tigers...

106
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,450
...it's been a long, dramatic,

107
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,590
somewhat confusing road.

108
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,790
As we draw this year to a close,

109
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,090
it's time to move on...

110
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,050
to a new phase of our lives.

111
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,210
Pray nothing crazy happens again

112
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,320
because are the Avengers even like a thing anymore?

113
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,960
Does anyone even have a plan?

114
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,490
I have a plan.

115
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,250
Okay. First, I'm gonna sit next to MJ on the flight.

116
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Second, I'm gonna buy a dual headphone adapter

117
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,490
and watch movies with her the whole time.

118
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,620
- Okay. - Three,

119
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,550
when we go to Venice,

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass right?

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,050
- True. - So, I'm gonna buy her a black dahlia necklace

122
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,020
because her favorite flower is the black dahlia

123
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,590
- because of, well... - The murder.

124
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,720
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

126
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,190
give her the necklace.

127
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,520
And then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

128
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,750
And then, six, hopefully she tells me

129
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,090
she feels the same way.

130
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,520
Oh, don't forget step seven.

131
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,620
- Step Seven. - Don't do any of that.

132
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,790
Why?

133
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,920
Because, we're gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter.

134
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,850
- Ned. - Look,

135
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,950
I may not know much, but I do know this:

136
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,950
Europeans love Americans.

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
- Really? - More than half are women.

138
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,290
Okay. Sure.

139
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,290
But... I really like MJ, man, okay?

140
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,320
She's awesome, she's super funny in a kind of dark way.

141
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,820
And sometimes I catch her looking at me,

142
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,120
and I feel like I've stood up...

143
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,150
- She's coming. Just don't say any... - What up, dorks?

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,320
Excited about the science trip?

145
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,920
Hey, yeah. We're just talking about the trip.

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Yeah, and Peter's plan.

147
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,320
You have a plan?

148
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,660
I don't... I don't have a plan.

149
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,020
He's... He's just gonna collect tiny spoons

150
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,590
when we're traveling to other countries.

151
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,950
Like a... Like a grandmother?

152
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,790
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.

153
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,320
He's collecting tiny spoons.

154
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,720
Okay, well...

155
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,990
that was a real roller coaster.

156
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,720
By the way, travel tip:

157
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,950
You should prabably download a VPN on your phone,

158
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,220
just so that the government can't track you while abroad.

159
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,160
Smart...

160
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,950
Will do.

161
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,020
Dude, I think that went really great.

162
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,490
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

163
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,450
the family that was living there was very confused.

164
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,950
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

165
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.

166
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,220
It was... It was really a mess.

167
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,990
Thank you all for coming out

168
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,650
to support those who have been displaced by the Blip.

169
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,920
And, of course, thanks to our very own

170
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,690
Spider-Man!

171
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,360
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

172
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,090
And thank you, you guys, for having me.

173
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,920
And thank you, Spider-Man.

174
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,820
He'll be right back out to take photos and videos.

175
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,690
Thank you!

176
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,250
- That was amazing. - That was great.

177
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,220
That was so cool. I was so nervous.

178
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,250
I was a little stiff. I felt like I wasn't in the pocket.

179
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,990
No, I thought you did great.

180
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,320
Yeah. I actually think you were a little stiff.

181
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,920
Uh, yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

182
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
- It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. - Okay.

183
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,720
- Did you get your passport? - Yeah.

184
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,320
- Mini toothpaste? - Yeah, I did.

185
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,390
Hey, sorry I'm late.

186
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,060
Happy.

187
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,620
Oh, you look lovely.

188
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,750
- Thanks. You too. - Thank you.

189
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,060
- New dress? - Yeah, yes, it is.

190
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,890
It's a new beard.

191
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,250
It's my... My Blip beard.

192
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,890
'Cause I grew it in the Blip.

193
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,890
It's a Blip beard.

194
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,390
I see. Yeah.

195
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,450
Anyway, so, the reason I'm late is because

196
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,590
this was misplaced at the office.

197
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,220
Can you believe it? Because, it's enormous.

198
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,420
Not the amount, the size.

199
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,110
The amount's nice too. They're generous.

200
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,120
- Pepper Potts said, sorry she couldn't be here. - Thank you.

201
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,150
I think I'm gonna go change the

202
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,290
Sterno under the vegan lasagna.

203
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,650
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

204
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,820
Will do.

205
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,950
What just happened?

206
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,250
Heads up,

207
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,120
Nick Fury's calling you.

208
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,520
- Nick Fury's gonna call me? - Yeah.

209
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,120
Why?

210
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,020
Why? He probably has hero stuff for you to do.

211
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,090
You're a superhero. He calls superheroes.

212
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,420
I mean, if it was really that important,

213
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

214
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,790
Apparently not.

215
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,520
See? No caller ID. That's him.

216
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,750
I don't really wanna talk to Fury.

217
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
- Answer the phone. - Why?

218
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,850
Because, if you don't talk to him,

219
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,090
I have to talk to him and I don't want to talk to him.

220
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,050
Why don't you want to talk to him?

221
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,720
Cause, I'm scared. Just answer the phone.

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,890
- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail? - Yeah.

223
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,020
You don't send Nick Fury to voicemail.

224
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,390
Did you heart that? They're calling me.

225
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,420
- I gotta go. I gotta go. - You gotta talk to him.

226
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm gonna call him. I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,990
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

228
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,890
I promise you, I'll call him.

229
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,790
After my trip.

230
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,120
Yeah, hi.

231
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,060
No, no, he's not ghosting you.

232
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,590
Okay, one question at a time.

233
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,190
Are you the head Avenger?

234
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,690
Are you the head Avenger now?

235
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,150
Uh, no, I'm not.

236
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,090
If aliens come back, what are you gonna do?

237
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,820
If aliens come back, what are you gonna do?

238
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,160
Does anyone have neighborhood questions?

239
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,750
Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.

240
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,650
What's it like to take over from Tony Stark?

241
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,220
Those are big shoes to fill.

242
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,490
I'mma...

243
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm gonna go. Thanks, everyone, for coming.

244
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,220
Okay.

245
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,320
Hungry?

246
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,690
So sorry.

247
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,450
I thought that you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.

248
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,990
Please do not start calling it my Peter-tingle.

249
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,190
So, what's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?

250
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,990
No, I just really need this vacation.

251
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,490
I need a break.

252
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,850
You deserve it.

253
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,350
Yeah.

254
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,060
You know what?

255
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,050
You should pack your suit, just in case.

256
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,420
I have a tingle about it.

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,520
Please stop saying "tingle," May.

258
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,060
No.

259
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,890
No. No, I'm not.

260
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,690
Yeah!

261
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,320
Can you help me get my stuff up?

262
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,850
- Oh, sorry, that's mine. - No worries.

263
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Give me a tablet.

264
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,750
Do you want first shift or second?

265
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I could take either.

266
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,420
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

267
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,790
I can't chaperone kids alone.

268
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,050
Yo, Parker.

269
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,790
This is called an airplane.

270
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,150
It's like buses you're used to,

271
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,320
except it flies over poor neighborhoods

272
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,790
instead of driving through them.

273
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,560
Ma'am?

274
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,820
He Blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21.

275
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,060
I'll take that.

276
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,560
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

277
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,850
Classic MJ, right?

278
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,560
Did you know Brad was coming?

279
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,250
It... It's so weird.

280
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,490
Like, one day, he's that kid who cried

281
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,690
and got nosebleeds all the time,

282
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,290
and suddenly, we Blip back,

283
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,790
and he's totally ripped and super nice

284
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,920
and all these girls are after him.

285
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,190
Not all the girls are after him.

286
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,350
No, man, they're all after him.

287
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,120
- Yeah. - Here.

288
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,620
Anyway, on to more important things.

289
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,890
It's a nine-hour flight.

290
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,760
We can play Beast Slayers the whole time.

291
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,590
Are you excited?

292
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,350
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

293
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,890
Seriously?

294
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,990
Yes, seriously.

295
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,150
What about our plan?

296
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,020
American bachelors in Europe.

297
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,720
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.

298
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,120
Come on, this is my plan.

299
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,190
Please.

300
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,590
Guys.

301
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
There's an old lady sitting in front of us

302
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,190
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

303
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,020
and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies.

304
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,160
You know, Betty, if you could just

305
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,890
switch seats with him, that would be...

306
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,220
He's allergic to perfume?

307
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,190
Yeah, yeah, because, um, it...

308
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,790
It makes his eyes water,

309
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,350
- and he can't really... - You said, Peter has a perfume allergy?

310
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,350
I'll tell you from experience,

311
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,950
perfume allergies are no joke.

312
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,890
I can feel hives breaking out already.

313
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,950
MJ, stand up.

314
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,150
Ned, take MJ's spot.

315
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,520
MJ, you take my spot.

316
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,620
Peter, come with me, let's get you out of there.

317
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,250
- Sorry. - Zach, Sebastian,

318
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,950
you take Ned and Peter's seats.

319
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,290
Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention.

320
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,820
Your safety is my responsibility.

321
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,020
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

322
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,620
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

323
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,320
Let's go!

324
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,490
Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle.

325
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,120
So did you wanna play Beast Slayer?

326
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,060
Nope.

327
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,350
Have you ever played any kind of PC game or...?

328
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,660
- No. - Got it.

329
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,490
Did I tell you my wife pretended to Blip out?

330
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,090
Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group.

331
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,120
We had a fake funeral for her and everything.

332
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,490
Well, the funeral was real

333
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,450
because I thought she was dead.

334
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,550
Do you wanna see the video?

335
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,020
I got a dual headphone adapter

336
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,350
if you wanna watch a movie.

337
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,090
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

338
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,820
You have a dual headphone adapter.

339
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,560
We can watch together.

340
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,050
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

341
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,520
this is your captain speaking.

342
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,790
Our flight time today will be

343
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,660
eight hours, 49 minutes to Venice, Italy.

344
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,220
Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ on the plane?

345
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,550
They were watching movies and laughing the entire time.

346
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,220
Dude, don't worry, okay?

347
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,390
I'm sure that's nothing.

348
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,220
Hey, babe.

349
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,690
Can you hold this for me?

350
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,250
- Yeah, of course. - Thanks.

351
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,190
What was that?

352
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,150
Well,

353
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,620
we acutally got to talking on the plane, and it turns out,

354
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,250
we have a lot in common.

355
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,590
So, uh, we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

356
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,750
Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?

357
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

358
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,020
And that boy met a woman.

359
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,020
A very strong and powerful woman.

360
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,420
And now, that boy's a man.

361
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,490
- Babe? - Coming, babe.

362
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,450
There's nothing in there. I swear.

363
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,990
These, no.

364
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,060
Sorry.

365
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,720
- I'm here. - Wait, wait, wait.

366
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,990
- I'm here. - Thank goodness.

367
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,820
Looks like we're here.

368
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,350
They're doing renovations to the place.

369
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,890
- Getting some upgrades. - Oh, this is trash.

370
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,420
That must be the concierge. Okay.

371
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,660
Come on, man.

372
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,850
Everyone, here we are.

373
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,090
This place is sinking.

374
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,220
- You mean, "Charming." - It stinks.

375
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,790
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

376
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,050
We're gonna meet at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

377
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,950
- ¡Vámanos! - It's "Andiamo."

378
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,950
Andiamo!

379
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,690
When in Rome, do as Romans do.

380
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,190
When you're in Venice, your socks get wet.

381
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,920
What's up, Flash Mob? How you guys doing?

382
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's...

383
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,520
- This is so much fun. - Yeah?

384
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,090
- Three, two, one... - Say pizza!

385
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,690
Pizza!

386
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,090
- Buongiorno. - Buongiorno.

387
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,850
I'm looking for a, uh...

388
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,960
It's perfect.

389
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,920
What?

390
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,990
It's the most perfect word in the world.

391
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,890
Italians created it, and I discovered it.

392
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,750
What does it mean?

393
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,220
That's the thing. It can means a million things.

394
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,920
I can mean... I don't know. Get out of my face.

395
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,560
I don't know and get out of my face.

396
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,220
It's the best thing Italy created, except for maybe espresso.

397
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,920
Oh, so you've been drinking espresso?

398
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,820
German? American.

399
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,190
A rose for you.

400
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,250
"Boh" is my new superpower.

401
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,520
It's like the anti-"Aloha."

402
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
I was born to say this word.

403
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,320
So, what's in the bag?

404
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,290
Nice.

405
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,390
Whoa, cool.

406
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,420
What was that?

407
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,390
- Betty! You okay? - Yeah.

408
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,650
- Oh, my God! - Come on.

409
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,390
Guys, we gotta go!

410
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,690
- What is that? - I don't know.

411
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,520
- What'll you do? - I left my suit's in the hotel room.

412
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,420
- Why? - I'm on vacation, Ned!

413
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,150
Everyone's gonna see my face. Just get them out.

414
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,650
- Go! Just go! - Go!

415
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,920
Get out of here. Go!

416
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,720
Oh, my God.

417
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,790
Come on.

418
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,190
Oh, no, you don't.

419
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,960
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

420
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,420
Excuse me, sir!

421
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
I... I can help. Let me help.

422
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,820
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

423
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,690
I need to lead it away from the canals.

424
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,090
The da Vinci Museum.

425
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,020
This is why we're here in Venice.

426
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,220
Oh, this is it.

427
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,590
It's closed.

428
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,690
What do you mean it's closed? Till when?

429
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,590
November.

430
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,350
You didn't check the website?

431
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,850
Oh, that's a good idea.

432
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,490
Oh, come on.

433
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,090
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

434
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,150
Who is that guy?

435
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,850
I don't know, but he's kicking that water's ass.

436
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,490
Yeah! Yeah!

437
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,220
It's aliens. It has to be.

438
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,620
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor, name Morris Bench,

439
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,050
who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator

440
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,550
and got hydro powers.

441
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,890
Yeah, you should definitely believe

442
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,520
everything you read on the Internet.

443
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,290
- Spider-Man could take him. - What do you think it is?

444
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,060
You know, being a man of science...

445
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,490
witches.

446
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,490
No, no, no. We wanna stay. We wanna stay.

447
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,320
It's a good thing that I packed your suit, huh?

448
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,820
I can't believe you forgot it.

449
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,960
Yeah.

450
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,890
So, who was that guy that you were with?

451
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,190
Was that Mr. Strange?

452
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,890
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.

453
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,800
And, no, I don't know who that was.

454
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,890
It was a new guy.

455
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,290
- I was trying to help him, but... - Happy,

456
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,490
that's my lunch.

457
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,490
Don't eat that one.

458
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,460
Happy's there?

459
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,260
Yeah, it's Happy.

460
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,990
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

461
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,090
And he's hanging around the office.

462
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,790
- And he wants to say hi. - I don't want... Hi, Peter.

463
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,420
Hey, Happy.

464
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,990
Sorry, I'm working hard here. I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

465
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,150
- What are you doing in...? - Glad you're having a good time.

466
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,090
Don't worry, I'm really taking care of your aunt.

467
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,790
So how's the plan going?

468
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,650
There's been setbacks, for sure.

469
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,320
Don't over think it, just trust your instincts, you'll be fine.

470
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,350
I know. Love you. Bye.

471
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,950
Who is that guy?

472
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,260
He's Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.

473
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,720
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

474
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,960
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

475
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,750
What? He's just awesome, okay?

476
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,050
He protects the neighborhood and, you know, he's inspiring.

477
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,890
He inspires me to be a better man.

478
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,590
What's up, dickwad?

479
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,890
Thought you drowned.

480
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,060
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

481
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,550
"L'uomo del misterio"

482
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,490
is Italian for "Man of mystery."

483
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,190
They don't actually know who he is.

484
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,220
Mysterio.

485
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,090
Cool name.

486
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,960
Babe.

487
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,060
So how much of that did you actually see?

488
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,960
Not much. I was running.

489
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,620
Right. Me too. I was also running...

490
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,290
away.

491
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,390
So Paris tomorrow.

492
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,720
Go to the Eiffel Tower.

493
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,990
Should be great.

494
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,890
Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna

495
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,650
to create an army of the insane.

496
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,390
Which is why it's my favorite destination on the whole trip.

497
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,590
What are you gonna do about the water monster?

498
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,790
Nothing. It's dead.

499
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,990
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

500
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,950
Look, I just wanna spend time with MJ.

501
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,350
We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me.

502
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,520
That's nice.

503
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,450
Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love.

504
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,720
I had just finished my fruit cobbler, and...

505
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,290
You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.

506
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,150
You're Nick Fury.

507
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,520
And you just shot Ned.

508
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,020
Just a mild tranquilizer.

509
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
He'll be all right.

510
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
So good to finally meet you.

511
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,590
I saw you at the funeral,

512
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,620
but I didn't think that was a good time to exchange numbers.

513
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,450
No, that would've been really inappropriate.

514
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,620
- That's what I just said. - Right.

515
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,220
The important thing is, you're here.

516
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,820
I tried to bring you here.

517
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,620
You avoided me, and now you're here.

518
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,290
What a coincidence.

519
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,720
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

520
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,650
I used to know everything.

521
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,620
Then I come back five years later,

522
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
and now I know nothing.

523
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,220
No intel, no team.

524
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,690
And a high school kid

525
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,850
is dodging my calls.

526
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,490
Here's what I do know:

527
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,150
A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone.

528
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,850
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

529
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,850
Three days later, a similar event in Morocco.

530
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,450
A village was...

531
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,320
Just making the rounds.

532
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,090
See if anyone needs any emotional counseling

533
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,950
after today's traumatic events.

534
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,490
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

535
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,120
Great because I'm... I'm not qualified to actually...

536
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,920
Oh, he's passed out.

537
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,760
I'm really not qualified to do it anyway, so good night.

538
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,720
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.

539
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,720
You were saying?

540
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,150
A village was destroyed by

541
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,020
what may well be another world-threatening...

542
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,390
Babe, you still awake?

543
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,390
You're not answering any of my texts.

544
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,120
He's asleep, Betty.

545
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,790
Oh, already?

546
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,520
- Yeah. - Okay.

547
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,490
That's why it's imperative...

548
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,750
Boys. So that canal water today

549
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,750
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

550
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,290
Another person touches that door,

551
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,650
you and I are going to attend another funeral.

552
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,240
Suit up.

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,990
Let me know if either of you develop vomiting.

554
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,520
Stark left these for you.

555
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,590
Really?

556
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,560
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."

557
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,120
Stark said you wouldn't get that

558
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,650
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

559
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,150
You can lose the mask.

560
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,890
Everyone here has seen you without it.

561
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,450
You'd only be feigning anonymity

562
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,990
and breathing through spandex for no good reason.

563
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,290
Come on.

564
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,290
Yeah.

565
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,450
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

566
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,920
That is Dimitri.

567
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,420
And this is Mr. Beck.

568
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,720
Mysterio?

569
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,850
What?

570
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,850
Doesn't matter.

571
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,820
It's what my friends have been calling you.

572
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,490
Well, you can call me Quentin.

573
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,850
You handled yourself well out there today.

574
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,390
I saw what you did with the tower.

575
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,450
We could use someone like you on my world.

576
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,450
Thanks.

577
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,520
I'm sorry. Your world?

578
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,290
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

579
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,050
Just not yours.

580
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,850
There are multiple realities, Peter.

581
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,260
This is Earth Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.

582
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,090
I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

583
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,520
'Cause I thought that was just theoretical.

584
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,590
I mean, that completely changes

585
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,120
how we understand the initial singularity.

586
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,990
We're talking about an eternal inflation system.

587
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,950
How does that even work with all the quantum...?

588
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,150
It's insane.

589
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,350
S-sorry. It's really cool.

590
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,060
Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.

591
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,150
Anyway...

592
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,920
They were born in stable orbits within black holes.

593
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,190
Creatures formed from the primary elements:

594
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,790
Air, water, fire, earth.

595
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,320
The Science Division had a technical name.

596
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,890
We just called them Elementals.

597
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,350
Versions of them exist across our mythologies.

598
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,090
Turns out, the myths are real.

599
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,120
Like Thor.

600
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,020
Thor was a myth, and now I study him in my physics class.

601
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,790
These myths are threats.

602
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,250
They first materialized on my Earth many years ago.

603
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,750
We mobilized and fought them,

604
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,260
but with each battle, they grew, got stronger.

605
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,620
I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them.

606
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,690
All we did was delay the inevitable.

607
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:45,090
The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates.

608
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,350
Our satellites confirm it.

609
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,090
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three.

610
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,260
There's only one left: fire.

611
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,090
The strongest of them all.

612
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,220
The one that destroyed my Earth.

613
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,790
It's the one that took my family.

614
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,490
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,390
And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.

616
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,350
We have one mission: kill it.

617
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,850
And you're coming with us.

618
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,090
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

619
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,220
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,

620
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,920
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

621
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,720
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

622
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,590
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

623
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,730
I know, but that was an accident.

624
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,350
Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use.

625
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,150
- What about Thor? - Off-world.

626
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,020
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

627
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,720
- Unavailable. - Captain Marvel.

628
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,950
Don't invoke her name.

629
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,790
Sir, look, I really wanna help. I do.

630
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,050
But if my aunt finds out I left my class trip,

631
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,890
she's gonna kill me.

632
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,190
And if I'm seen like this in Europe

633
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,250
after the Washington Monument,

634
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,590
my whole class will figure out who I am, and then...

635
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,490
Then the whole world will figure out who I am,

636
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,590
then I'm done.

637
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,820
Okay.

638
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,490
I understand.

639
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,120
I'm sorry, what?

640
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,090
Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you

641
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,590
and become suspicious.

642
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,720
Dimitri.

643
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,990
Take him back to the hotel, please.

644
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,290
Yes.

645
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,720
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

646
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,590
And, uh, good luck.

647
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,390
See you, kid.

648
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,990
Yeah, see you.

649
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,820
- Bye, ma'am. - Yeah.

650
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,590
Okay, drink lots of water.

651
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,450
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

652
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,120
You cannot get sick, okay, babe?

653
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,390
Okay. Thanks, baby.

654
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,060
Hey, man, are you sure you're good?

655
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,820
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

656
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,350
- Okay. Nice. - Don't worry.

657
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,350
Seriously, getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,

658
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,220
probably the coolest thing ever happen to me anyway.

659
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,620
- It is pretty awesome. - Yeah.

660
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,190
I'm just happy I don't have to go to Prague.

661
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,690
- Seriously. - Good news.

662
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,220
We're going to Prague.

663
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,950
- What? - Prague?

664
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,790
Yeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us.

665
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
You should've heard me on the phone with them.

666
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,060
I really gave them hell.

667
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,250
All I heard was crying.

668
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,290
Look at our upgraded ride.

669
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,190
Bro, you see that?

670
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,620
It's pretty sick.

671
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,150
I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.

672
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,460
Oh, come on.

673
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,650
Peter, what...? What's going on?

674
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,890
I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation.

675
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,220
I'm, uh, Mr. Harrington to the kids...

676
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,450
- Oh, all right. - Okay.

677
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,650
Awesome.

678
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,560
Yeah. Awesome.

679
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,420
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob? It's your boy, the Big F,

680
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,420
cruising through the Alps with my private driver, Dimitri.

681
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,750
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

682
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,120
Say EDITH."

683
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,460
Stand by for retinal and biometric scan.

684
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,490
Retinal and biometric scan accepted.

685
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,420
- Hello? - Hello, Peter.

686
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,920
I am EDITH,

687
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,560
Tony Stark's augmented-reality security and defense system.

688
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,590
- So he made you for me? - No.

689
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,820
- But you have access to all of Tony's protocols. - Cool.

690
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,890
Would you like to see what I can do?

691
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,090
EDITH stands for "Even dead, I'm the hero."

692
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,250
Tony loved his acronyms.

693
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,590
Yeah, he did.

694
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,720
I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network,

695
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,820
including multiple defense satellites,

696
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,620
as well as back doors to all major telecommunication networks.

697
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,690
Is MJ texting?

698
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,710
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.

699
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,090
That's wrong. That's wrong.

700
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,860
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

701
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,920
Flash Mob, this is what we doing out here...

702
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,290
Toilet, toilet, toilet. Which way to the toilet?

703
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,120
Ten minutes, everyone.

704
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,650
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

705
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,950
- Okay. - Oh, my gosh,

706
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,120
- I'll figure it out. - it's so sick.

707
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,490
It's beautiful.

708
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,390
What?

709
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,320
Hello.

710
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,750
Close the door.

711
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,120
I'm Peter Parker.

712
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,490
Take off your clothes.

713
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,020
- Excuse me? - You told Fury

714
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.

715
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,560
So I made you this, another suit.

716
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,650
Thank you.

717
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,290
I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try...

718
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,620
- Take off your clothes. - Okay.

719
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,750
Sure.

720
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,990
- It's a little embarrassing. - Now. Hurry up.

721
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,920
This is weird.

722
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,990
No, no, no. Don't...

723
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,900
Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.

724
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,550
This is not what it looks like.

725
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,890
- Just... - Yeah.

726
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,720
What are you doing?

727
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,590
- Brad. - I'll leave you two alone.

728
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,460
Oh, my God.

729
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,220
Don't shoot anybody. Brad?

730
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,990
It's not what it looks like, buddy.

731
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,350
- Hey, man, look, that's... - Look, Peter,

732
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,320
I'm not here to judge your life choices, dude.

733
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,290
If you want to hook up with some random European chick,

734
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,520
- on our school trip, that's on you. - No.

735
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,720
That's not what that was, honestly.

736
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,950
I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

737
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,250
I know you're trying to get with MJ. It's obvious.

738
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,020
- But I like her too. - Wait a minute.

739
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,290
You cannot show her that photo, dude. Come on.

740
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,860
I'm sorry, man. I have to.

741
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,750
She deserves the truth.

742
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,320
Okay, put your one foot in front of the other,

743
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,150
and, everybody, back on the bus.

744
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,860
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

745
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,190
- EDITH? - Hello, Peter.

746
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,360
How can I help you?

747
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,850
There's this guy in my class who's gonna ruin everything...

748
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,920
Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.

749
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,460
Can you please speak up?

750
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,450
Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

751
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,390
Brad Davis. Is he a target?

752
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,650
Is Brad a target?

753
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,460
Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.

754
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,490
Copy that.

755
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,250
Target is Brad Davis.

756
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,790
Initiating strike.

757
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,920
Initiating what, now?

758
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,250
Intercept point determined.

759
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,360
- Releasing kill vehicle. - EDITH.

760
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,790
- Oh, my God. - Dope glasses, Parker.

761
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,220
- How'd you pay for these? - Flash, give them back.

762
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,960
- No, no, no. - Give it to me, Flash.

763
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,920
- I'm really paying you a compliment. - Please give me...

764
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,860
I'm so sorry.

765
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,050
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

766
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,250
Peter, do you want me to cancel

767
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,520
the drone strike on Brad Davis?

768
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,220
- Did you just punch Flash? - No.

769
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,190
Firing.

770
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,720
Oh, look out!

771
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,550
This is not the autobahn!

772
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,890
EDITH.

773
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,990
Commencing second strike.

774
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,590
Peter. Plant your fanny and buckle up, right now.

775
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,750
Look at the baby mountain goats!

776
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,250
- Baby mountain goats? - Ooh, I see them.

777
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
I don't see any mountain goats.

778
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,790
You missed them.

779
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,520
I know you think none of us have noticed, Peter...

780
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,560
What?

781
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,590
...but your new look, I love it.

782
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,090
- Right, babe? - Thanks.

783
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,220
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European.

784
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,460
Oh, man.

785
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,250
Let's try that again.

786
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,950
This is so weird. It was right here on my phone.

787
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,620
- I-I... - Yeah. Weird.

788
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,360
- Freaking beautiful. - This is amazing.

789
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,690
This place is so classy.

790
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,190
Yeah, so why are we here?

791
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,520
Speak for yourself.

792
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,060
I'm home.

793
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,750
What can I say?

794
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,720
The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease.

795
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,420
Everyone get settled in, rest up because tonight, big surprise,

796
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,590
is Prague's annual...

797
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,720
- ...Carnival of Lights. - Yeah!

798
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,320
- Hello? - Parker, it's Hill.

799
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,620
There's an earpiece with your suit.

800
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,190
Put it on and await further instructions.

801
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,190
- Understood? - Uh, yes, ma'am.

802
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,890
- Yeah. - Hey, man.

803
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,920
Look, I am so sorry

804
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,750
if I seem like I'm preoccupied with my relationship.

805
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,020
You know, I'm still your guy in the chair.

806
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,950
No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

807
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,020
- Okay. Great, great. - It's fine.

808
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,290
So, what's the status on the Elemental thing?

809
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,720
- Where's it gonna happen? - Uh, here in the city.

810
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,150
- Peter, we're here. - I know, I know. It's not good.

811
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,590
It's... I'm figuring it out.

812
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,550
You have to do something, Peter, please.

813
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,050
We're all counting on you.

814
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,890
- Ned. - Yeah. Yeah, babe.

815
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,460
The good news is, we've all got our own rooms.

816
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,290
- It's about time. - Serious?

817
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,120
- Parker? Parker! - Yes, sir.

818
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,520
That thing is going to be here in a few hours.

819
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,990
- Are we boring you? - He's not bored.

820
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,740
He's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.

821
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,400
He had obstacles.

822
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,140
I removed them.

823
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,110
And they still won't evacuate the city.

824
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,640
Idiots.

825
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,770
So, what's the plan, Parker?

826
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,270
I will be in the cathedral tower,

827
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,770
keeping watch for the fire monster.

828
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,110
When that shows up, I will radio you guys,

829
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,400
- and then Mr. Beck and I will... - My name is Mysterio.

830
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,370
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

831
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,740
Peter, listen to me.

832
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,070
The best hope you have, the only hope,

833
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,770
is to stop it here now,

834
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,510
no matter what the cost.

835
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,770
Maneuver it away from civilians if you can,

836
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,140
but most important, keep it away from metal.

837
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,300
If it gets too big,

838
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,600
it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core.

839
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,570
After that, there's no way to stop it.

840
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,510
Hey, man, my friends are here.

841
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,740
I can't help but think that we're putting them in danger.

842
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,970
You're worried about us hurting your friends?

843
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,440
You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus?

844
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,500
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar

845
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,970
A.R. Tactical intelligence system,

846
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,540
and the first thing you do with it

847
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,800
is try and blow up your friends.

848
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,970
It's clear to me that you were not ready for this.

849
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,340
Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing.

850
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,740
He just... He felt bad about snapping at you.

851
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,570
Really?

852
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,570
You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right?

853
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,140
How you feeling?

854
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,710
I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer.

855
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,900
I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just...

856
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,240
I had this plan with this girl that I really like...

857
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,340
and now it's all ruined.

858
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,240
You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid.

859
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,570
It's a hard path.

860
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,170
You see things. You do things.

861
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,540
You make choices.

862
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,640
People look up to you...

863
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,270
and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die.

864
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,710
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

865
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,140
There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just...

866
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,900
turn around, run away from all this.

867
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,400
Then there's another part of me

868
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,270
that knows what we're about to fight,

869
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,510
what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here.

870
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,540
Me too.

871
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,770
But you're worried about your friends.

872
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,940
Yeah.

873
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,400
Just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.

874
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,600
Look, just get them inside

875
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,270
and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours.

876
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,110
They'll be all right.

877
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,970
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to about

878
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,440
superhero stuff, you know?

879
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,240
Anytime.

880
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,200
And, hey, we survive this,

881
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,010
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

882
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,900
See you out there.

883
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,070
All right.

884
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,670
Scusi.

885
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,340
Sorry, that's Italian.

886
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,700
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

887
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,770
Hello, Peter.

888
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,900
I need to find a way to keep my friends

889
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,270
inside the next few hours.

890
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,670
Let's see what we can do.

891
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,440
Good news.

892
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,470
We're going to the opera!

893
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,170
- You're kidding me. - The opera?

894
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,400
Don't look at me.

895
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,840
What happened to the carnival?

896
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,540
This is upgrade living, guys.

897
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,140
Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets.

898
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,370
For free!

899
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,400
Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?

900
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,140
No,

901
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,870
because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.

902
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,900
Well, I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.

903
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,040
Thank you, Ned.

904
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,570
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

905
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,540
the best four hours of our whole trip.

906
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,970
Four hours?

907
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,670
Guys, I think this is gonna be fun. Seriously.

908
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,200
I bet now you're all happy that I had you pack a nice outfit.

909
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,870
Yeah, because we'd much rather go to a four-hour opera

910
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,740
instead of the biggest party in the world.

911
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,710
Again, don't look at me.

912
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,010
Parker, do you copy?

913
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,670
Comm check, one, two.

914
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,870
Okay, here we are.

915
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,770
Beat the rush.

916
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,010
Yeah, the rush out.

917
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,570
Lucky for us, we got the best seats in the house.

918
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,670
Let's go.

919
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,610
I'll save you a seat.

920
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,070
You look really pretty.

921
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,840
And therefore, I have value?

922
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,770
No. No, that's not what I meant at all. I was just...

923
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,040
I'm messing with you.

924
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,370
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

925
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,340
- You look pretty too. - Thank you.

926
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,770
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses! - So cute.

927
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,040
- Can I...? - Yeah.

928
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,740
Want to go in on a pair?

929
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,800
You mean, sit next to each other?

930
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,610
Yeah.

931
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,340
Are you in position?

932
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,770
- No. - Okay. No...

933
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,100
{\an8}Why the hell not? Parker?

934
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,870
You don't want to sit next to me,

935
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,140
or, no, you just don't want the glasses?

936
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,400
I didn't mean that.

937
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,900
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

938
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,970
I'll save you a seat next to me.

939
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,100
- Awesome. - A lot of seats,

940
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,140
so I'll be up there.

941
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,070
Okay.

942
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,400
- Parker. - No, I'm coming. I'm...

943
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,670
I gotta go.

944
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,440
Could you just tell MJ that I'm sick or something?

945
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,400
Okay. Be careful.

946
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,500
And Peter, whatever you do,

947
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,300
please steer the monster away from the opera house.

948
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,370
Yeah, Ned, I know.

949
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,340
- Okay. - Okay?

950
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,110
- Yeah. - Gotta go.

951
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,470
Parker! You better be on your way.

952
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,170
Coming.

953
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,470
Where do you think she's going?

954
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,600
Do you think she's going to the carnival?

955
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,070
- Oh, I... I don't... - We should go, too.

956
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,070
Yes, we should go.

957
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,340
Come on, let's go.

958
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,740
Come on.

959
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,440
All right. I'm in position.

960
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,940
As soon as I see something, Beck, I'll, uh...

961
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,300
I'll let you know.

962
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,710
- Roger that. - How's the suit?

963
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,770
The suit's great. It's awesome.

964
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,340
It's a little tight around the old web-shooter.

965
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,920
Parker!

966
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,300
Okay, I'll shut up.

967
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,870
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

968
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,210
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

969
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,610
- What's wrong? - You know, honestly, I just...

970
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,400
I don't do well with big crowds, so maybe we should...

971
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,040
I have the perfect thing.

972
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,070
Come on.

973
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,100
Don't worry, babe.

974
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,740
We'll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air.

975
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,710
You'll feel a thousand times better.

976
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,670
Energy spiking.

977
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,270
We have seismic activity.

978
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,770
Okay, he's here!

979
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:07,900
Beck, are you ready?

980
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,970
You know what to do.

981
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,470
On your lead, Spider-Man.

982
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,700
No, come back!

983
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,470
Come back and help us!

984
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,240
You're up, kid.

985
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,300
Wait, wait. Is that...?

986
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,010
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

987
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,490
No, no, no.

988
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,170
It's a European rip-off version of him.

989
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,400
I was actually read about him the other day. It's not him.

990
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,860
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

991
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,940
He's getting bigger!

992
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,010
What's his name? What's his name?

993
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,140
It's Night... Night Monkey.

994
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,040
- Night Monkey? - Yeah. Yeah.

995
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,270
Night Monkey!

996
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,570
- Yeah. - Night Monkey, help!

997
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,290
Night Monkey.

998
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,050
- Save us! - What?

999
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,500
Night Monkey, we're stuck!

1000
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,800
- Oh, no, no. - Help us! Help!

1001
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,440
Are you okay?

1002
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,140
- On to Plan B? - Yeah!

1003
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,970
We gotta hit him with something he can't absorb!

1004
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,370
I go left, you go right!

1005
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,770
Now!

1006
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:01,900
Okay, shoot him!

1007
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,400
Yeah!

1008
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,710
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

1009
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,610
Spider-Man, keep your distance.

1010
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,010
I'm trying!

1011
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,600
Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.

1012
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,340
Okay. I'm on it!

1013
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,670
What is that?!

1014
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,010
Betty! Betty!

1015
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,570
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

1016
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,640
No, no, no.

1017
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,340
It's too late.

1018
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,070
Whatever happens...

1019
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,240
I'm glad we met.

1020
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,470
Beck, what are you doing?

1021
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,800
What I should have done last time.

1022
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,540
Beck, don't do it!

1023
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,770
Beck!

1024
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,140
Mr. Beck?

1025
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,540
Oh, thank God.

1026
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,740
I would totally kiss you,

1027
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,070
but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.

1028
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,470
I might have a mint.

1029
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,440
So it's over?

1030
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,900
That was the last of them.

1031
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,640
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

1032
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,070
We need to stay vigilant.

1033
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,740
There's a void in this world for someone like you.

1034
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,270
Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

1035
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,900
You should join us.

1036
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,770
Thank you. I just might take you up on that.

1037
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,740
You got gifts, Parker,

1038
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,370
but you didn't wanna be here.

1039
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,100
Mr. Fury, I...

1040
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,670
I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

1041
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,340
But you got to decide whether you're going to step up or not.

1042
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,800
Stark chose you.

1043
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,070
He made you an Avenger.

1044
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,240
I need that.

1045
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,470
The world needs that.

1046
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,400
Maybe Stark was wrong.

1047
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,870
Was he?

1048
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,740
The choice is yours.

1049
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,540
Let's get a drink.

1050
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,370
I'm not 21.

1051
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,840
You gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight.

1052
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,110
Yeah.

1053
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,610
Fury was right.

1054
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,070
Tony did a lot for me, so...

1055
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,040
I owe it to him, to everybody.

1056
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,670
Do you?

1057
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,840
Yeah. I mean...

1058
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,540
Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.

1059
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,370
He wanted me to be better than him.

1060
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,140
And Fury just wants me to live up to that.

1061
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,740
What do you want, Peter?

1062
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,840
- What do you mean? - What do you want?

1063
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,400
I don't know.

1064
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,970
What do you want? You, Peter Parker. Now.

1065
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,770
I know you're thinking about it.

1066
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,670
I wanna go on my trip, right?

1067
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,970
I want to go back on my trip with my friends.

1068
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,900
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

1069
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,570
with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel, and...

1070
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,670
give her a kiss.

1071
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:09,640
Shut up, man.

1072
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,940
You're not gonna do that, are you?

1073
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,700
- No, I can't. - Why not?

1074
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,940
Because I have too much of a responsibility.

1075
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,370
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much. - What are those?

1076
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,200
- Are those the...? - EDITH glasses, yeah.

1077
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,440
They were just on the floor?

1078
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,840
Try them on. Let's see how they look like.

1079
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1080
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,270
I actually really like them.

1081
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,040
Can I be completely honest with you?

1082
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,770
Please.

1083
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,770
They look really stupid.

1084
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,670
But maybe they have a contact-lens version.

1085
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,170
You try them on.

1086
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,040
- No, come on. - Try them on.

1087
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,170
- I don't wanna try them on. - Just put them on.

1088
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,170
What do you think, kid?

1089
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,000
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1090
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,000
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1091
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,870
What?

1092
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,130
Mr Stark left me a message with those glasses:

1093
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,350
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1094
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,980
I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?

1095
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,790
He knew every mistake I ever made.

1096
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,790
So, he must've known that I wasn't ready for something like this.

1097
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,950
Why would he give it to you?

1098
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,560
Because maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,

1099
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,540
he just trusted me to pick who should.

1100
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,290
It makes much more sense. He always knew I'd do what's right.

1101
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,420
And he's not gonna give them to Fury

1102
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,930
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

1103
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,220
You're probably right about that.

1104
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,970
Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man.

1105
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,640
And it's not me. I mean, I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1106
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,510
It needs to be an adult with some experience

1107
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,790
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

1108
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,000
No. Peter, come on.

1109
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:46,920
No.

1110
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,670
- EDITH? - Hello, Peter.

1111
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,030
Yeah, um...

1112
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,250
I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.

1113
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,820
- Peter, what are you doing? - Doing the right thing.

1114
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,450
Any transfer will require confirmation.

1115
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,200
Stark gave you the glasses.

1116
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,280
Stark gave me a choice.

1117
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,380
It's my choice to make. Okay? I'm gonna make it.

1118
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,190
Look, you're a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals.

1119
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,130
You saved my life. You saved the world, okay?

1120
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,570
He'd want you to have them.

1121
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,390
Waiting for confirmation.

1122
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,420
Confirm.

1123
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,890
Welcome to the Avengers.

1124
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,250
They look good on you.

1125
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,010
Thank you.

1126
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,440
It's an honor.

1127
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,160
Yeah.

1128
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,360
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

1129
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,630
- Where you headed? - I'm gonna go find MJ.

1130
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,390
Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance.

1131
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,860
You're pretty awkward. So...

1132
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,510
Yeah.

1133
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,110
- See you later, man. - See you.

1134
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,290
See? That wasn't so hard.

1135
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,400
Yes!

1136
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:32,500
Somebody get this stupid costume off me!

1137
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,820
Okay, we got EDITH.

1138
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,460
Get these connected to our system.

1139
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,050
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1140
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,220
Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.

1141
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,970
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1142
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,520
Yeah!

1143
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,780
Okay, toasts!

1144
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,230
Give me that, Doug.

1145
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,340
To the man who brought us all together,

1146
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,370
our former boss, Tony Stark.

1147
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,200
The jester king.

1148
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,810
Literally wrapped in wealth and technology

1149
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,260
that he was unfit to wield.

1150
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,280
Like the holographic system I designed.

1151
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,880
A revolutionary breakthrough

1152
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,200
with limitless applications

1153
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,530
that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...

1154
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,290
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1155
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,410
$611 million for my little therapeutic experiment.

1156
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,760
He renamed my life's work...

1157
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,650
"Barf."

1158
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,310
I told him it was a mistake,

1159
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,350
that my technology could change the world.

1160
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,800
And then...

1161
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,240
he fired me.

1162
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,160
Said I was...

1163
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:46,700
unstable.

1164
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,540
To Tony.

1165
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,340
To Tony!

1166
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,300
Next, to William.

1167
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,760
William!

1168
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,810
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1169
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,910
With a box of scraps!

1170
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,390
The integration of my illusion tech

1171
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,740
with your weaponized drones was brilliant.

1172
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,520
Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm.

1173
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,700
And it's just the beginning.

1174
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,720
- Thank you, brother. - To Guterman.

1175
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,070
- Guterman! - To Guterman!

1176
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,180
The story you created

1177
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,000
of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin

1178
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,370
fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous

1179
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,840
and apparently exactly the kind of thing

1180
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,180
people would believe right now.

1181
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,790
I mean, everybody bought it.

1182
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,520
- Gutes! - Guterman!

1183
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,510
- To Victoria. - To Victoria!

1184
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,750
Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site

1185
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,270
so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies.

1186
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,030
Inspired idea.

1187
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,090
- To Janice. - Janice!

1188
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,430
After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that

1189
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,340
EDITH was being handed over not to us,

1190
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,290
not to the Defense Department,

1191
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,700
but to a child.

1192
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,460
- Thank you. - To Janice!

1193
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,750
And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone.

1194
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,240
There's a window of opportunity, and someone will step up.

1195
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,900
But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room,

1196
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,350
the most qualified, and no one cares.

1197
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,220
Unless you're flying around with a cape

1198
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,970
or shooting lasers from your hands,

1199
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:02,510
no one will even listen.

1200
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,270
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

1201
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,150
With our technology and with EDITH,

1202
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,060
Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth!

1203
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,330
Yeah!

1204
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,050
Then everyone will listen!

1205
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,810
Not to a boozy man-child.

1206
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,120
No!

1207
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,000
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1208
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,350
No!

1209
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,110
To me...

1210
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:35,600
and to my very wealthy crew.

1211
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,920
To us.

1212
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,820
To us.

1213
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,340
To Mysterio!

1214
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,150
To Mysterio!

1215
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,470
To Peter Parker.

1216
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,250
To Peter Parker!

1217
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,230
Poor kid.

1218
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,220
Let's get to work.

1219
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,580
Peter, oh, my God.

1220
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:56,810
We almost died.

1221
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,150
It's fine. It's fine.

1222
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,870
Guess what, I'm done with the mission.

1223
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,070
- Dude, the trip's over. - What?

1224
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:04,300
There's monsters coming out of the ground everywhere we go.

1225
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,740
Of course our parents would want us home.

1226
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:09,010
Don't put me on hold. Peter, you're not dead.

1227
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:11,220
Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here.

1228
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,890
Don't... Put some clothes on. We're booking flights.

1229
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,410
We came for science, we're leaving because of witches.

1230
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:18,080
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

1231
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,740
- What is going on, dude? - We're going home in the morning.

1232
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,900
No, no, no. All the Elementals are gone.

1233
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,150
- Ned. - Coming, sweetie.

1234
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,150
Can you guys keep it down? I'm live-streaming.

1235
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,710
Where were you?

1236
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,990
I got lost.

1237
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,950
We were worried about you.

1238
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,820
Good thing you're back.

1239
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,300
Yeah.

1240
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,490
So much for Paris, right?

1241
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,680
It would've been fun.

1242
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:48,410
Yeah.

1243
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:49,660
Night.

1244
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,280
Night.

1245
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,150
You look ni...

1246
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:01,650
Okay.

1247
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,100
Look, um...

1248
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,730
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet, and

1249
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,780
I kind of want to do something fun

1250
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,840
that's not on the itinerary or planned

1251
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,150
or with Mr. Harrington.

1252
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,010
Yes.

1253
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,990
"Yes," Like you wanna go?

1254
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:22,010
Yes.

1255
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,330
Okay. Awesome. I'll see you outside in 10 minutes.

1256
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:27,850
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1257
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,560
- Five is good. - Okay.

1258
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,240
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

1259
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,330
So where do you wanna go?

1260
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,330
- Who cares? - Awesome.

1261
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,410
- Okay. - Let's go.

1262
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:01,440
I'm glad we're doing this.

1263
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,380
- Yeah, me too. - To see the city a bit.

1264
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,770
You know, they used to execute people on this bridge.

1265
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,170
They would put them in a basket,

1266
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,590
and they would drown in the water.

1267
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,360
- Sorry. - It's okay.

1268
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,250
There's this thing that

1269
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:25,110
I've been wanting to talk to you about for a while.

1270
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,550
Yeah?

1271
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,710
It's our last night in Europe,

1272
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:34,450
and I had this plan that I wanted to tell you.

1273
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,610
I'm just gonna tell you.

1274
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,650
MJ, I...

1275
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:40,700
"I'm Spider-Man."

1276
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:44,000
- What? - That's what you were gonna say.

1277
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,040
That you're Spider-Man.

1278
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,890
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1279
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,010
I mean, I've been watching you for a while now.

1280
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,220
It's kind of obvious.

1281
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,270
I'm not Spider-Man.

1282
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,010
What would make you think that I was Spider-Man?

1283
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:02,160
- Peter, Washington? - Yeah?

1284
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:06,090
The fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason.

1285
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,820
No, I was sick. Remember?

1286
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,000
I had my... The tummy?

1287
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,880
You know, Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1288
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,970
What? No. Of course I'm not a male escort.

1289
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:14,050
Well, then you're Spider-Man.

1290
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:17,270
- No, I'm not Spider-Man at all. - What about tonight?

1291
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,460
You snuck off and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1292
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,970
You can't have seen me because I'm not Spider-Man.

1293
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,850
And also, on the news, it was the Night Monkey.

1294
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,190
- The Night Monkey? - Yeah.

1295
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,800
That's what it said on the news,

1296
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,710
and the news never lies.

1297
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,450
Night Monkey. Okay.

1298
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:34,720
What are you doing?

1299
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,430
Well, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man

1300
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,830
use the same webs?

1301
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:42,470
I mean, maybe.

1302
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,910
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey. Who knows?

1303
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,740
Were you only watching me

1304
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,450
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1305
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,430
Yeah.

1306
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,530
Why else would I be watching you?

1307
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,820
Doesn't matter.

1308
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,050
Just thought that maybe...

1309
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,130
What the hell was that?

1310
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,950
I don't know.

1311
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,980
What is it, like some kind of projector or something?

1312
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,390
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1313
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:34,880
It... It looked so real.

1314
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,040
Yeah, really real.

1315
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,240
- Wait, does that mean that...? - The Elementals are fake?

1316
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,370
That doesn't make any sense because we were there, right?

1317
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,610
There was fire and destruction, and...

1318
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:50,960
Who would do something like that?

1319
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:01,880
Mysterio.

1320
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,030
I am Spider-Man.

1321
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,630
And I've really messed up.

1322
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:13,370
Wait. You're b-being serious right now?

1323
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,350
You're not joking with me? Like, you're 100 percent serious?

1324
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,190
- Because it's not funny. - No, I'm not joking.

1325
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,650
Because I was only like 67 percent sure.

1326
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,500
- MJ... - So why are you here?

1327
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,960
Why are you on this school trip?

1328
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,460
MJ, look, I know you have a lot of questions,

1329
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,300
but look, we really have to get out of here, okay?

1330
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,900
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1331
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,450
You took everything from me!

1332
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,170
This is for my family!

1333
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,880
Pause.

1334
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,640
Pause.

1335
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,810
Sorry.

1336
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,280
Yeah, can you just fast-forward to the end?

1337
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,500
Yep. Stand by.

1338
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,610
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1339
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:03,730
Pause. I'm not in love with this choreography,

1340
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,470
but it'll do.

1341
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,520
Kill image.

1342
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,450
De-cloak drones.

1343
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,480
All right, weapons.

1344
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,410
- You want to weaponize? - Yep.

1345
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,370
Weapons only. Stand by.

1346
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,350
Nice.

1347
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,880
Stop.

1348
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,380
Something. I don't know what it is.

1349
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,430
It's something...

1350
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:30,960
Just dou... You know what?

1351
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,180
Double the damage and then run it again.

1352
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:35,710
You want me to double it up?

1353
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,210
- Yeah. - All right.

1354
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,250
Cover your ears.

1355
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,970
That is good! That's good.

1356
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,380
- We on schedule? - Oh, yeah.

1357
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,910
Uploading software hack to EDITH network.

1358
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:55,640
With her drones,

1359
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,440
we'll be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.

1360
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,850
All right. Well done. Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.

1361
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,960
We need maximum damage.

1362
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,670
- That's gonna cause a lot of casualties. - Oh, yeah.

1363
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,490
More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static.

1364
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,310
London's a beautiful city, and it'll suffer,

1365
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,190
but they can rebuild. I mean, if I'm gonna be the next Iron Man,

1366
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,300
I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat.

1367
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,870
But when its new savior descends,

1368
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,410
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1369
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,910
Janice, you'll be in position with my quick-change armor

1370
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:27,070
- for the victory lap? - Of course.

1371
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,950
- You wanna try...? - No, that's...

1372
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,860
What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?

1373
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,920
One of the drones that came back from the plaza

1374
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,760
was missing a projector. It's fine.

1375
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:39,120
Wait, and you're...? You're telling me this now?

1376
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:43,020
It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.

1377
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,390
That projector is evidence.

1378
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,550
It's gonna tell people what we're doing

1379
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:46,730
and how we're doing it.

1380
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,060
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,

1381
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,650
including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid

1382
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,790
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1383
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,630
And if he catches on before I've killed him,

1384
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,030
and he will put a bullet in my head.

1385
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,470
And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right?

1386
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:03,650
Right?

1387
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,770
William, can you look at me?

1388
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,210
Pull up EDITH.

1389
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,400
Hello, Quentin.

1390
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,190
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,

1391
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,130
full-resource protocol for this device.

1392
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,490
Magnifying.

1393
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,230
There. Search everything going in and out of that building.

1394
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,210
Located.

1395
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:27,840
Shit.

1396
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,170
You know, William, one day,

1397
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:35,890
after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this,

1398
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:39,890
I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands!

1399
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,230
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.

1400
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,590
I mean, how could I be that stupid?

1401
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,260
He's probably spying on me right now

1402
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,170
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1403
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:53,060
You had access to killer drones?

1404
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,240
Yeah, I didn't really want them,

1405
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,250
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1406
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,260
You almost killed Brad?

1407
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,190
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury

1408
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,830
and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but...

1409
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:03,350
I think he tapped my phone.

1410
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,710
Okay. So, what are you gonna do?

1411
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,660
I need my suit,

1412
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,980
and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1413
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:15,750
Just...

1414
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,740
Ned, perfect.

1415
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,860
The costume looks great...

1416
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,600
for the costume party

1417
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,990
at the prince's castle.

1418
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,370
She knows. I told her.

1419
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,940
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1420
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,420
That's cool.

1421
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,960
Like, a long time ago.

1422
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,120
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1423
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,450
But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1424
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,520
No. He's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.

1425
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,380
Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.

1426
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,860
That's crazy.

1427
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,810
Yeah.

1428
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,390
So you guys were like working the case together or what?

1429
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,580
It's been mostly me.

1430
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,450
Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1431
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,350
say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin,

1432
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,680
until this all blows over. Okay?

1433
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,910
Got it. Easy.

1434
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,240
You guys lie with such ease.

1435
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,850
I gotta go.

1436
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,110
Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1437
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,520
You're gonna need this.

1438
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,320
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

1439
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,870
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1440
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,380
So you know too.

1441
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,730
It's cool. I mean, I've known first, and I've known longer,

1442
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:47,290
but it's not a competition.

1443
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,640
Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1444
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,890
- Nacht Monkey! - No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1445
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,490
Get in.

1446
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:24,990
Mr. Fury...

1447
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:27,630
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1448
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,780
- No, no, no, listen. - Wait until we're secure.

1449
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:31,170
Okay.

1450
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,470
Right.

1451
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:06,590
So is there anything you want to tell us

1452
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,720
about your girlfriend?

1453
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,210
He's talking about EDITH.

1454
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,830
Look, I know I made a mistake, I'm sorry,

1455
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,390
but he is not who you think he is.

1456
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,570
Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals,

1457
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,890
it's all fake. He has some illusion tech.

1458
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,830
And that's how he tricked you guys, and me into giving him EDITH.

1459
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,290
It's a projector.

1460
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,860
I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.

1461
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,220
So all that death and destruction we witnessed

1462
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,850
was created by this?

1463
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,490
No, not just this. I think he's using drones.

1464
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,970
Well, if this is true,

1465
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:36,430
then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1466
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,200
Who else did you tell about this?

1467
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,260
Parker? Parker!

1468
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,920
- What's wrong? - It's Beck. He's here.

1469
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,440
What? Hill?

1470
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,330
No, it's just an illu...

1471
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,150
Fury!

1472
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:01,940
Peter.

1473
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:04,770
I thought we were close.

1474
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:08,820
Fury always had to die, but not you.

1475
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,510
Stop hiding, Beck!

1476
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,730
I tried to help you walk away.

1477
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,780
Now you're making me do this.

1478
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,440
You told me, you were just a kid.

1479
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,990
You told me, you wanted to run after that girl.

1480
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,370
- Help me! - MJ!

1481
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:32,860
Oh, God!

1482
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,840
Peter, what's going on?

1483
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,370
I know this isn't real.

1484
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,820
Do you, though?

1485
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,860
MJ
MJ!

1486
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,410
MJ
MJ!

1487
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,060
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1488
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,850
You need to wake up!

1489
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,370
I mean, look at yourself.

1490
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:42,120
You are just a scared little kid

1491
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,660
in a sweat suit.

1492
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,450
I created Mysterio

1493
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,140
to give the world someone to believe in.

1494
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,690
I control the truth.

1495
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,700
Mysterio is the truth.

1496
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,500
If you were good enough,

1497
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,870
maybe Tony would still be alive.

1498
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:38,330
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1499
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,240
You made your choice.

1500
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,420
And all you had to do was step aside.

1501
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,500
And now you have...

1502
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,090
Fury.

1503
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,520
Beck's people are trying to find

1504
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,670
everyone who could expose him.

1505
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:17,870
Who'd you tell?

1506
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,780
I know you told someone...

1507
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,810
...so just tell me.

1508
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:22,470
- Okay. - Who did you tell?

1509
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:23,820
Who else did you tell?

1510
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,750
Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1511
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:27,180
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,

1512
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:28,200
but that's it.

1513
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,590
What?

1514
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:33,750
You are so gullible.

1515
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:35,970
- What? - I mean, you're smart as a whip.

1516
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:36,990
Just a...

1517
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:39,140
...sucker.

1518
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,470
And now all your friends have to die.

1519
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,230
Oh, my God.

1520
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,500
It's easy to fool people

1521
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,420
when they're already fooling themselves.

1522
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,920
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1523
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:00,090
I really am sorry.

1524
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,090
- EDITH. - Yes, Quentin.

1525
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,370
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1526
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,610
I need them to fly home from London.

1527
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,520
Where am I?

1528
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,800
Municipal holding facility.

1529
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:04,720
They said they found you unconscious at the train yard.

1530
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:05,990
Very dangerous.

1531
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,150
And we gave you the shirt

1532
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:08,990
because you seemed a bit cold.

1533
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,420
Thanks.

1534
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,200
You guys are nice.

1535
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,030
You speak really good English.

1536
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,040
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1537
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,530
I'm in the Netherlands right now?

1538
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,180
Yep.

1539
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:24,940
Bye.

1540
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,660
- Guard! - The guard is on a break.

1541
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,920
- Probably talking to his wife. - Yeah, she's pregnant.

1542
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,390
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

1543
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,440
Yeah.

1544
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,210
Yeah.

1545
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,060
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1546
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:51,910
You guys okay?

1547
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,100
- Excuse me, sir? - Yeah?

1548
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,450
- Could I borrow your phone? - Yeah.

1549
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,180
Everyone is so nice here.

1550
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,410
Okay.

1551
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,450
Okay.

1552
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,160
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1553
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,210
I messed up. I need a... I need a ride.

1554
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,720
Where am I? Where am I, sir?

1555
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:33,490
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1556
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,220
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1557
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,190
It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1558
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,970
Yeah, no problem.

1559
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:44,890
Thanks.

1560
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,680
Did you get that?

1561
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,500
Peter? Are you okay?

1562
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:13,760
- Happy, is that you? - Is it me? Yeah, of course it's me.

1563
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,300
Stop! Tell me something only you would know.

1564
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:18,540
Only I would know.

1565
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,940
Remember we went to Germany?

1566
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,030
You pay-per-viewed a video in your room?

1567
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:25,860
They didn't list titles, but I could tell by the price

1568
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,680
it was an adult film at the front destk.

1569
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,900
- And you didn't know how I knew... - Okay. Okay,

1570
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,630
fine! It's you. It's you. It's you. Stop.

1571
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:34,880
It's so good to see you.

1572
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,470
Peter, you gotta tell me what the hell is going on here.

1573
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,700
Okay, hold still.

1574
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:42,870
There we go.

1575
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:52,150
I thought you had super strength.

1576
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:53,480
It still hurts.

1577
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:58,340
- Happy, come on. - All right, relax.

1578
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,370
- Just a few more. There we go. - Oh, my God.

1579
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,420
- Relax. - Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1580
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,720
How can I relax when I messed up so bad?

1581
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,810
I trusted Beck. Right?

1582
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,030
I thought he was my friend.

1583
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:13,700
So, I gave him the only thing that Mr. Stark left behind for me,

1584
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,740
and now he's gonna kill my friends and half of Europe,

1585
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,590
so please do not tell me to relax.

1586
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,040
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't shout.

1587
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,890
I just really miss him.

1588
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,270
Yeah, I miss him too.

1589
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,740
Everywhere I go...

1590
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,480
I see his face.

1591
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,240
And the whole world is asking

1592
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,410
who's gonna be the next Iron Man... And

1593
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,610
I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.

1594
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,380
You're not Iron Man.

1595
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,300
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1596
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,030
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1597
01:26:58,890 --> 01:26:59,920
Not even Tony.

1598
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,100
Tony was my best friend.

1599
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,980
And he was a mess.

1600
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,040
He second-guessed everything he did.

1601
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,600
He was all over the place.

1602
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,450
The one thing that he did that he didn't second-guess

1603
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,500
was picking you.

1604
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,200
I don't think Tony would have done what he did

1605
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:19,790
if he didn't know that you were gonna be here

1606
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:20,900
after he was gone.

1607
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,380
Now, your friends are in trouble,

1608
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,360
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1609
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,820
What are you gonna do about it?

1610
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:37,770
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1611
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:41,170
I mean, right now. Like specifically, what are we gonna do?

1612
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,950
Because we've been hovering over a tulip field

1613
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,110
for the last 15 minutes.

1614
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,900
Right. I can't call my friends

1615
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,290
because he's tracking their phones.

1616
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,590
Give me your phone.

1617
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,080
- My cell phone? - Yeah.

1618
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,590
Okay. Here.

1619
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,160
What's your password?

1620
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:54,310
"Password."

1621
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,760
No, what is your password?

1622
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,640
"Password," Spelled out, password.

1623
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,480
You're the head of security,

1624
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:59,730
and your password is "Password"?

1625
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,040
I don't feel good about it either.

1626
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,560
Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?

1627
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,460
I'm gonna be in London soon.

1628
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,230
- They're in London. - London, okay.

1629
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,550
Yeah, I need a suit.

1630
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,460
Suit?

1631
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,190
Okay, um...

1632
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,380
bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.

1633
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:44,680
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1634
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,860
- What? - Nothing.

1635
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,900
You take care of the suit. I'll take care of the music.

1636
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:03,040
I love Led Zeppelin.

1637
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:10,750
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1638
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,650
Isolate the Taser webs,

1639
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,220
and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1640
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:19,370
to a factor of 25 percent,

1641
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:22,360
and give me complete manual control over detonation.

1642
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,260
I thought Kree having sleeper cells

1643
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,300
was top secret information.

1644
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,560
Nick, satellites are picking up an EM pulse.

1645
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,780
I thought that was over.

1646
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:34,070
It's the biggest one yet.

1647
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,800
- Where? - London.

1648
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,410
Okay, guys, the company set up a city tour,

1649
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:40,740
and then we'll grab a bite and head to the airport.

1650
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,310
Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?

1651
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,680
Oh, yeah, I get it. There's been nothing scientific

1652
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,370
about this science tour at all.

1653
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,070
No, no, I'm talking about Peter.

1654
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:54,150
Has no one else here noticed how shady he is?

1655
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,790
Because I saw him in the back room of a rest stop

1656
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,850
with some woman in his underwear,

1657
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,430
and he's always sneaking away,

1658
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,460
like back at the opera, huh?

1659
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,130
And, now what, he's suddenly off the trip,

1660
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,840
like with his family in Berlin?

1661
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,410
Is no one else here interested in the truth?

1662
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,970
"The very concept of objective truth

1663
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,430
is fading out of the world."

1664
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,700
George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.

1665
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,890
Yeah. Well, I mean, since Peter's not really here

1666
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,030
to tell his truth,

1667
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,820
what about you, Brad?

1668
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,160
Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?

1669
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,940
Yeah, dude, what's that about?

1670
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:26,090
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1671
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,550
I was trying to take a...

1672
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,820
Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1673
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:33,000
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1674
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,470
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington," Said the class. Okay.

1675
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,160
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1676
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:42,520
You gotta stop doing that. Okay? It is weird.

1677
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,160
No more photos in the bathroom.

1678
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,450
Urinal or stalls.

1679
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,350
- Okay? - Look at this.

1680
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,550
Mr. Harrington, come on,

1681
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,040
- this is your bus. - We got a bus all to ourselves.

1682
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,000
Nice to see you all. Come along.

1683
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:55,340
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not? - Let's go. Thank you.

1684
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,740
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1685
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:58,150
All right.

1686
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,350
I have the kids.

1687
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:06,230
I got here as fast as I could.

1688
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,920
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1689
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:10,800
Damn it.

1690
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,460
Pulse is spiking.

1691
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,460
I'll take another look.

1692
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,320
Soon as you see something, report.

1693
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,630
You're all we've got, Beck.

1694
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,560
If this is what I fear,

1695
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,940
then God help us, Fury.

1696
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:25,220
God help us all.

1697
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,950
Okay, people, no Avengers coming. We're good to go.

1698
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,700
- William, launch the drones. - Copy that, brother.

1699
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:35,120
Drones are entering the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1700
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,190
- Excellent. Janice? - Still working on the cape.

1701
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,140
You gotta get those wrinkles out.

1702
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,310
In a few hours, I could literally be shaking hands with the queen.

1703
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:47,930
- Guterman? - Almost in position.

1704
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,200
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria. - Increasing pulse.

1705
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,400
Whatever this thing is,

1706
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,610
it's 100 times bigger than the previous ones.

1707
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,420
Edith?

1708
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:57,910
Yes, Quentin.

1709
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,210
Show me my loose ends.

1710
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,110
Once the show's going,

1711
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:04,010
execute the kill order on my command.

1712
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:05,140
- Copy. - All right.

1713
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,360
Start the show.

1714
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,340
Let's save the world, people.

1715
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,580
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1716
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,650
You're an FOS now. "Friend of Spider-Man."

1717
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:21,180
And you have to remember, just stay calm.

1718
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,580
Ned, that doesn't look good.

1719
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,230
But it's fake, so, there's nothing to worry about.

1720
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,290
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1721
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:34,480
Great work, Guterman.

1722
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,450
- What? - Happy here. Happy Hogan here.

1723
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:40,590
I know. What do you want?

1724
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,550
Over at Mr. Stark's, going through his belongings.

1725
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:44,870
Apparently there was a surfboard you left behind.

1726
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:46,130
- What? - People over there said

1727
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,550
they didn't think Nick Fury was a surfer,

1728
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,740
but I said, "Appearances can be deceiving."

1729
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,950
It's not mine. And don't ever call this number again.

1730
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,710
Okay. Fury's got the coded message.

1731
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,940
- Your friends are at the Tower Bridge. - Okay.

1732
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,900
Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out.

1733
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,350
- I'm gonna go scoop them up, okay? - Yeah.

1734
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:10,410
- We're close. - We're close.

1735
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,850
- How's the suit coming? - Almost done.

1736
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:12,990
- Good. - Wait, wait.

1737
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,820
Before you go, if something happens to me,

1738
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,470
could you please give this to MJ?

1739
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,010
You are gonna make it back. You'll give it to her yourself.

1740
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,390
- Okay? You got this. - I got this.

1741
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:24,320
- Walk me through it. - I know it's illusion tech, right?

1742
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,360
All I do is get on the inside of the illusion,

1743
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,410
then I can take it down,

1744
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,970
find him, and he's just a guy.

1745
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,510
So, I can take EDITH right back.

1746
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,830
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1747
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:35,600
True, but this time...

1748
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,040
How do I explain this?

1749
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,220
I have a sixth sense.

1750
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,370
The Peter-tingle.

1751
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:42,740
That's what you're talking about, right?

1752
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,900
It's not working, though.

1753
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,000
I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?

1754
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,780
It is working.

1755
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,260
- I don't know if it's working... - Good.

1756
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,300
Okay. You got the Peter-tingle. That's the plan.

1757
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:51,540
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1758
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,410
You get that Peter-tingle back online.

1759
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,530
I got this. I got this.

1760
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,790
Cue the lightning.

1761
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,260
Cuing lightning.

1762
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,520
Sir, is it still safe on the top,

1763
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,910
or should we all come down?

1764
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:22,650
Oh, my.

1765
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,050
What did the bus driver say?

1766
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,500
Bus driver's gone.

1767
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,200
- What? - Where?

1768
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,020
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control!

1769
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,950
No. Don't drag me into this.

1770
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,820
I'm doing my best, Julius!

1771
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:38,670
- Look... - Oh, the witches are back.

1772
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,890
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1773
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:48,330
Okay, follow me, kids.

1774
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:52,440
Come on, let's go!

1775
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,410
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1776
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,560
This way. This way!

1777
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,490
- Okay. Okay. - Oh, my God!

1778
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,110
- Flash! - Follow that hand.

1779
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,760
This way. Follow me.

1780
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,520
It's not real, it's not real!

1781
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,160
Well, it looks pretty real to me!

1782
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,510
Follow me, kids!

1783
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,880
Earth, wind, fire, water. Oh, no.

1784
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,920
They joined forces like the Power Rangers.

1785
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,840
- You're thinking of Voltron. - Who?

1786
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,710
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1787
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:47,390
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1788
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:48,660
He's gonna save us!

1789
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,870
Wait, if Mysterio knows we know...

1790
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,180
- Then we're in danger. - Yeah, and so are they.

1791
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,010
We should go.

1792
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:00,440
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1793
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,510
This is for my family!

1794
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,660
You should get somewhere safe, Fury.

1795
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,650
I don't see this ending well.

1796
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:11,280
I appreciate your concern,

1797
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:13,990
but I never leave my men behind.

1798
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,340
All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid?

1799
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,330
Yeah. I can. It's a little loud out here.

1800
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,100
- I like the new suit. - Thanks.

1801
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:23,270
Peter, you sure that's not real?

1802
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:25,990
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger than I expected.

1803
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,980
Still the play?

1804
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,310
We need to get high enough

1805
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:30,000
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1806
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,930
Copy. Stay sticky.

1807
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,050
- Happy. - Yeah, kid. What is it?

1808
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:40,130
We need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt!

1809
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,370
Beck, report!

1810
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:58,470
Guterman, I need a response.

1811
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:59,120
Something quick and decisive.

1812
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,770
"It's all the Elementals.

1813
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,560
They're somehow merged into something..."

1814
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,750
...into something else. Something more powerful.

1815
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,810
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1816
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,410
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1817
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:17,950
Is that...?

1818
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,030
Be ready for anything.

1819
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,170
Yeah.

1820
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,400
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1821
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,500
That's awesome.

1822
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,580
William, I've got drones breaking formation.

1823
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:11,990
Maybe they hit a flock of birds. You're fine.

1824
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:14,280
I wanna see what's happening there, I'm taking manual control.

1825
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,810
Do you see anything?

1826
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:23,580
Yeah.

1827
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:25,890
And I'm gonna kill him.

1828
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,000
I hope this works.

1829
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,540
You got me?

1830
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,530
I got you.

1831
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:58,330
Boss, the illusion is coming apart.

1832
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:02,530
I see you.

1833
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:09,040
- EDITH, give me some protection. - Copy.

1834
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,100
Kill it. Just kill the illusion. Kill it.

1835
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,480
No, I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.

1836
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,200
They'll see what I want them to see!

1837
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,320
- Do you still need the cape? - Yes, Janice.

1838
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,380
- I still need the cape. - Done.

1839
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,690
- Now William render my illusion suit. - All right, hang on.

1840
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:41,900
The monster was full of drones! It's crazy!

1841
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:42,980
There you are.

1842
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:47,900
Easy.

1843
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,600
Who the hell is that?

1844
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,330
- Ned! - Happy!

1845
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,180
I gotta get you guys out of here!

1846
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,620
- Get on the jet! - Who are you?

1847
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,860
I work with Spider-Man. Okay? You gotta get on that jet.

1848
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:02,880
You work for Spider-Man?

1849
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,160
I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man.

1850
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:10,730
- New plan. Into the Tower. - What?

1851
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:11,810
Happy, are you okay?

1852
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:13,620
Yeah. We're okay. Just get Beck.

1853
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,940
- EDITH, target Spider-Man. - Copy.

1854
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,350
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1855
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:38,680
There you are.

1856
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:42,890
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1857
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:45,240
- Yeah, go, go, go! - Come on.

1858
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:49,930
- Go! - Into the vault!

1859
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:52,340
The walls are 8 feet thick. Go into the vault!

1860
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,980
- What? - Into the vault. Go!

1861
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:57,590
Take cover!

1862
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:17,560
Okay.

1863
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:23,420
Yeah?

1864
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,780
No. No.

1865
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:30,880
I see you.

1866
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,470
Get that thing out...

1867
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,100
Go!

1868
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,170
How does Cap do that?

1869
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:02,340
Happy, say something, please, to let me know you're alive!

1870
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,860
- I'm here. I'm here. - Happy, thank God.

1871
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:06,080
I bought us some time,

1872
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,610
but not much.

1873
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:11,420
I'm trying to get to Beck, but I can't shake these drones!

1874
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,040
Gotcha.

1875
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,670
Going up!

1876
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:28,760
Finally.

1877
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,790
William, how we doing?

1878
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:32,660
Illusion almost back up.

1879
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,130
I don't know how you're gonna spin this.

1880
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,750
Oh, great. No webs.

1881
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:07,650
- Are we gonna die? - Nobody dies on my watch.

1882
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,870
I wasted my life playing video games,

1883
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:13,180
and we're gonna die.

1884
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:15,160
I have a fake ID,

1885
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,070
and I've never even used it.

1886
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:20,930
I post stupid videos daily for people to like me.

1887
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:23,000
If it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1888
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,800
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1889
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:27,340
Spider-Man...? Spider-Man follows me?

1890
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:29,080
I saved us, guys.

1891
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,810
If you saved us, then why are we about to die?

1892
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:32,170
- MJ! - Stop it!

1893
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:33,690
I'm sorry, okay?

1894
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,260
It's just, I'm obsessed with telling the truth

1895
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:37,270
even if it hurts other people's feelings.

1896
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,100
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1897
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,580
We're sharing, right?

1898
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,360
Your lies are over, Beck.

1899
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:30,890
This certainly isn't ideal, but I have contingencies.

1900
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:31,730
Edith?

1901
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:42,020
Just give me the glasses.

1902
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:43,900
You want these?

1903
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,360
Come and get them.

1904
01:45:57,310 --> 01:45:58,740
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1905
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:24,870
Why aren't these drones firing?

1906
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:26,250
You're in the strike zone.

1907
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,330
- The chance of getting hit is... - No,

1908
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:31,230
fire all the drones now!

1909
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,060
Beck!

1910
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:55,420
Beck.

1911
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:57,550
You lied to me.

1912
01:46:58,630 --> 01:46:59,750
And I trusted you.

1913
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:00,910
I know.

1914
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:02,510
That's the most...

1915
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:05,030
d-disappointing part.

1916
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,390
You're a good person, Peter.

1917
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:12,430
Such a weakness.

1918
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,900
Stark was right.

1919
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:18,280
You do deserve them.

1920
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:31,750
You can't trick me anymore.

1921
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,280
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1922
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:41,810
Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter.

1923
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:44,180
Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?

1924
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:44,840
Just do it.

1925
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,940
- Execute them all. - Confirmed.

1926
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,790
Give me the spear.

1927
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,400
That's a halberd.

1928
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:05,320
Thank you.

1929
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:11,320
How could you do all of this?

1930
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,490
You'll see, Peter.

1931
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,860
People, they need to believe.

1932
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:20,840
And nowadays...

1933
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:24,890
they'll believe anything.

1934
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:36,640
Is he...?

1935
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,510
Is this real?

1936
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:43,070
All illusions are down, Peter.

1937
01:48:58,790 --> 01:48:59,490
Yeah!

1938
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,820
Where you going?

1939
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:10,060
MJ
MJ.

1940
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:14,170
- Are you okay? - I'm okay. Are you okay?

1941
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:16,840
- Yeah. Yeah. - Is everybody else okay?

1942
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:18,000
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1943
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:22,140
- What happened? - There was just the drones,

1944
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,850
and they were following us, and then they just stopped.

1945
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:28,190
- Was that you? - Yeah.

1946
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:30,620
Did you get him?

1947
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,990
- Yeah. - Well, I, um...

1948
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,020
brought that.

1949
01:49:39,450 --> 01:49:40,790
In case you needed some help.

1950
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:42,170
Thanks.

1951
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:46,130
Anyway, uh,

1952
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:49,230
there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us.

1953
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:51,270
I think he's like, works for you or something.

1954
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,500
He, um...

1955
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,360
He gave me this.

1956
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:57,130
No. No.

1957
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,890
MJ, I'm so sorry.

1958
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,870
- I had this plan. I had this stupid plan. - Peter.

1959
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,680
I wrote it all down, and I was gonna buy you this

1960
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,470
and give it to you in Paris at the top...

1961
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,640
And you kissed me.

1962
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,670
- What? What? - Yeah.

1963
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,460
I don't really have much luck

1964
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,730
when it comes to getting close to people.

1965
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:20,970
So I lied.

1966
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:24,610
I wasn't just watching you

1967
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:27,220
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1968
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:32,720
That's great.

1969
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:37,200
- Black dahlia, like the murder. - The murder.

1970
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,910
- Good. - Yeah.

1971
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:40,750
Sorry it's broken.

1972
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:43,170
I actually like it better broken.

1973
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:46,370
I really like you.

1974
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:49,160
I really like you too.

1975
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,460
Okay. I should...

1976
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:08,660
I should probably get back to the class.

1977
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:09,440
I'll go and...

1978
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:13,140
- Yeah. Heh. I don't know. - Heh. Okay.

1979
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,900
Just in case.

1980
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,170
Yeah, no.

1981
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,500
No, May, you're right.

1982
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,460
He did great. He was strong.

1983
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:31,090
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1984
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,270
I gotta go.

1985
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,200
Well, I'm glad you're alive.

1986
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:36,920
I guess the coded message worked.

1987
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,000
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1988
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:42,280
I'm surprised you didn't just wink in the camera.

1989
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,890
- It worked. - Only because I had serious doubts

1990
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,080
about Beck from the beginning.

1991
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,770
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1992
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,350
Where's Parker?

1993
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:53,680
He's with a girl.

1994
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,100
I need to speak with him.

1995
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,880
He'll call you.

1996
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,050
He'll...?

1997
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,350
Okay. Great.

1998
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,700
Well, he better.

1999
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:08,730
Or it's your ass.

2000
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:12,740
And don't even think about ghosting me.

2001
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:31,960
Are you sure no one else has figured it out?

2002
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,110
Yeah, I mean, it's not like anybody really pays attention to you.

2003
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:36,910
Ouch.

2004
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,620
Except for me.

2005
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,100
Thanks.

2006
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,920
- Don't be late. - I won't.

2007
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:42,710
See you later.

2008
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:45,690
- You guys are so cute. - Thanks.

2009
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,860
I was thinking that maybe we should all,

2010
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,290
I don't know, like go on a double date or something.

2011
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:53,430
We broke up.

2012
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:55,200
No. What? Why?

2013
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,060
Men and women grow apart,

2014
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:59,310
but the journey they share together

2015
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,890
will always be a part of them.

2016
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:04,570
- You are so wise. - Thank you.

2017
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:08,700
Hello, Gerald.

2018
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,450
Could Mother not make it?

2019
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,360
- May! - I promise you...

2020
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,410
He's here. Don't give me a ticket.

2021
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,670
I'm so glad you're okay.

2022
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:29,100
No, for real, I'm good. I'm actually really fine.

2023
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,880
Let's go. Where are your bags?

2024
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:32,330
Oh, right. They got blown up.

2025
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:33,190
Yeah.

2026
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:35,530
I got you hot buttered bagels.

2027
01:53:35,530 --> 01:53:37,540
- Thank you so much. - I know my boy.

2028
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:41,160
I kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years.

2029
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:42,950
I faced a lot of deception.

2030
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:45,620
And I'm tired of the lies.

2031
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:48,020
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

2032
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:52,300
Are you dating?

2033
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,590
- Yes. - Not really.

2034
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:57,450
- What? - Well...

2035
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:59,360
- I think... - Summer fling.

2036
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,600
Yes, that evolves and grows like any other.

2037
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:02,810
I still don't know where it's going to go.

2038
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,690
Open to wherever it might lead.

2039
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:05,530
Anywhere.

2040
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:06,930
- On or off. - To share it with people...

2041
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:08,610
We'll always be friends, no matter what.

2042
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:10,930
I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

2043
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:13,520
...because we all are interconnected.

2044
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,660
- Bye. - We are.

2045
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:34,350
Sorry!

2046
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:12,960
Sorry I'm late.

2047
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:15,400
- It's fine. - You ready?

2048
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:17,120
- Yeah. - You're gonna love this.

2049
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:19,230
Okay! Okay!

2050
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:21,040
- Okay. Okay. - You ready?

2051
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,420
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch. I'm not gonna watch.

2052
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:28,800
I should stop looking. I'm gonna stop looking!

2053
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:47,950
Okay. You can put me down now! You can put me down now!

2054
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:50,870
You okay?

2055
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:56,970
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

2056
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,920
Let's just... Never, never doing that again.

2057
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,950
- I'm never doing that again. - Okay.

2058
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,650
I should probably get out of here.

2059
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:05,230
- Be safe. - See you later.

2060
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:10,610
This is breaking news.

2061
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:11,290
We come to you now with

2062
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:13,550
revelations about last week's attack in London.

2063
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:15,740
An anonymous source provided this video.

2064
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:18,630
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,

2065
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:20,520
moments before his death.

2066
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:23,060
A warning, you may find this video disturbing.

2067
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,910
I managed to send the Elemental back through the dimensional rift,

2068
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:26,940
but I don't think I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive.

2069
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,810
Spider-Man attacked me for some reason.

2070
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:31,310
He has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology,

2071
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:33,700
he's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man.

2072
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:34,950
No one else.

2073
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:37,500
Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack?

2074
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,290
There will be significant casualties.

2075
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:41,480
Do it. Execute them all.

2076
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:48,670
This shocking video was released earlier today

2077
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:50,190
on the controversial news website

2078
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:51,770
TheDailyBugle.Net.

2079
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,650
There you have it, folks,

2080
01:58:52,650 --> 01:58:55,230
conclusive proof that Spider-Man

2081
01:58:55,230 --> 01:58:58,290
was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio,

2082
01:58:58,300 --> 01:58:59,780
an interdimensional warrior

2083
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:01,860
who gave his life to protect our planet

2084
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:04,300
and who will no doubt go down in history

2085
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:07,490
as the greatest superhero of all time.

2086
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,440
But that's not all, folks.

2087
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,240
Here's the real blockbuster.

2088
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,910
Brace yourselves. You might wanna sit down.

2089
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:15,480
Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is...

2090
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:21,200
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

2091
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:23,320
What the fu...?

2092
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:32,840
You gotta tell him.

2093
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:36,610
It was fine.

2094
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:39,030
The little boy handled it.

2095
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,970
We helped.

2096
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:42,220
- Talos. - Come off it.

2097
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:42,970
How was I supposed to know

2098
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:44,780
that the whole thing was fake?

2099
02:07:44,850 --> 02:07:47,200
I mean, that was all very, very convincing, you know.

2100
02:07:47,210 --> 02:07:48,980
The performances, the illusion,

2101
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:50,970
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

2102
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:54,140
I mean, this is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine.

2103
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:59,410
Hey there. I hope your mission is going well.

2104
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:03,080
We gave the glasses to Parker about a week ago, like you said.

2105
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:06,700
And it was very touching, you know?

2106
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:08,500
Really, really quite touching.

2107
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,490
Talos.

2108
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:13,520
And, you know, shortly after that,

2109
02:08:14,490 --> 02:08:16,090
it really kind of went off the rails,

2110
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:17,400
so we need you to come back.

2111
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,590
Cause, everyone kept asking where the Avengers are,

2112
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:20,900
I don't know what to say to that,

2113
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:22,780
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won...

2114
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:46,910
Everybody back to work!

2115
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,340
Who's got my shoes?
